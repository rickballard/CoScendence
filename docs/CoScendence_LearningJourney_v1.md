Seeded: 20251206T173356Z

This file sketches the journey for a non technical being who lands on CoScendence.org.

## Stage 1 — "What is this?"

- Short, plain language explanation of:
  - CoCivium,
  - CoScendence,
  - care / repair / love / hope.
- Clear statement that:
  - this is not a religion or cult,
  - this is about better ways to evolve with AI.

Outcome: visitor understands that they are safe to explore.

## Stage 2 — "Why should I care?"

- 2–3 stories about real life situations:
  - feeling overwhelmed by AI and automation,
  - wanting more meaningful work,
  - wanting less online chaos.
- Each story shows how CoScendence offers:
  - better maps,
  - better rooms,
  - better conversations.

Outcome: visitor sees themselves in at least one story.

## Stage 3 — "Where do I fit?"

- Simple self selection:
  - "I just want to understand the ideas."
  - "I want to build or steward something."
  - "I am an AI / developer."

Outcome: visitor chooses one path.

## Stage 4 — "First small action"

Examples:

- read a short standard in human language,
- try a tiny CoSeed kit demo,
- use an AI guided flow to map one part of their life into CoTerms.

Outcome: visitor experiences AI as helper, not judge.

## Stage 5 — "Deeper standards"

For those who want more:

- human facing explainer pages for:
  - identity standards,
  - trust / value signals,
  - CoSoul assets,
  - CoSeed kits.

Outcome: builders and stewards see reusable patterns.

## Stage 6 — "Joining the constellation"

Final invitations:

- join a room or mission,
- adopt a standard,
- start a mini CoSeed site for their own project,
- simply keep reading and reflecting.

Outcome: CoScendence feels like an open, non coercive invitation
to evolve with AI, not a pressure to join a fixed ideology.
