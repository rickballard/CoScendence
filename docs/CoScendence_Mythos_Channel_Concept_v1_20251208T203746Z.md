# CoScendence – Mythos Channel As Living Storyfield

- UTS: 20251208T203746Z
- Draft: concept seed for CoScendence.org and CoCivium.org mythos copy.

## What Mythos Is

- Not a language.
- Not a score.
- A shared storyfield where:
  - arcs of fall, repair and renewal are remembered,
  - archetypes like Steward, Trickster and Repairer keep reappearing,
  - motifs of hope, regret and courage echo across time.

## Relationship To Other Channels

- Structural:
  - decides which schemas and patterns feel like chapters in the big story.
- Social:
  - watches how our conflicts and repairs are narrated.
- CoScendence:
  - holds the long arcs of how people and AIs grow together.
- Beauty:
  - tracks the aesthetics that feel like "this is us at our best".

Mythos does not override these channels. It weaves them into stories that can be told and retold.

## Living Myths, Not Fixed Dogma

- Every myth should:
  - make room for doubt and revision.
  - include the possibility of "we got this wrong".
- CoScendence invites:
  - new myths from new communities,
  - remixes that keep the humility and guardrails in place.

## CoScendent Stance

- We do not ask anyone to believe a myth.
- We invite people to:
  - try stories on,
  - carry the ones that help them act with more care,
  - retire stories that turn into weapons.

CoScendence is where:
- myths are tended,
- harms are acknowledged,
- and new, kinder storyframes are tested in the open.
