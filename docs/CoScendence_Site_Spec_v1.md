# CoScendence Site Spec (v1)

Seeded: 20251206T173356Z

## Purpose

CoScendence.org exists to:

- Welcome beings who have never heard of schemas or standards.
- Explain CoScendence as a practical process, not a religion or cult.
- Show maps of the CoCivium / CoSuite constellation in human terms.
- Front the standards work: identity, trust, value signals, CoSeed kits, CoSoul assets.
- Provide clear paths for:
  - curious individuals,
  - builders and organisations,
  - AIBs and developers.

## Core messages

- CoScendence is the process of evolving with AI through care, repair, love and hope.
- CoScendence is not a religion or cult.
- You do not need to be technical to begin.
- AI should do the heavy lifting; beings bring their stories, values and intent.
