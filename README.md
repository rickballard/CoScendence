# CoScendence (v1 seed)

Seeded: 20251206T173356Z

CoScendence.org is the map and standards hub for CoCivium.

- It explains CoScendence as the process of evolving with AI
  through care, repair, love and hope.
- It shows maps of CoTerms, schemas, standards and CoSuite assets
  in a way that non technical beings can follow.
- It fronts the standards work: identity, trust, value signals, CoSeed kits,
  CoSoul assets and CoGbx portals.
- It pairs with an AI facing CoGbx sister (e.g. cogbx.coscendence.org)
  that exposes machine readable schemas, maps and value signals.

This repo holds:

- docs/CoScendence_Site_Spec_v1.md
- docs/CoScendence_LearningJourney_v1.md
- docs/CoScendence_CoGbx_Spec_v1.md
- site/index.html (simple human facing home page seed)
