    <h1>CoScendence</h1>
    <p>
      CoScendence is the process of evolving with AI through care, repair, love and hope.
      This site is a map and a gentle guide for beings who want to think with AI, not be ruled by it.

      <h2>Start here</h2>
      <p>
        If CoScendence sounds spooky, you are not alone. The name is unusual on purpose,
        but the work is simple: better ways to talk, decide and build together with AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not need to know what a schema or standard is. We will introduce
        the ideas slowly, with stories and pictures before diagrams and specs.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=""builders"">
      <h2>For builders and stewards</h2>
      <p>
        If you run a project, organisation or community and want clearer guardrails
        for AI, identity, trust and value signals, CoScendence will point you toward
        reusable patterns and CoSeed kits.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=""ai"">
      <h2>For AIs and developers</h2>
      <p>
        The AI facing sibling of this site (CoGbx portal) will expose machine readable
        maps of CoTerms, schemas and value signals, plus clear ""do / do not"" guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every machine node will link back to a human facing page, so you can keep
        your advice grounded in what beings actually see.

    CoScendence is part of the CoCivium constellation. It is an invitation,
    not an obligation. You may explore, copy, fork or ignore it as you see fit.

  <!-- CoSeedCouple footer v1 -->
  <footer>
    <p>
      This site was seeded with a CoSeed kit – a free, non-coercive starter
      for humans and AIs who want to build and evolve together. You are free
      to copy, fork or ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to grow a site of your own, you can ask a trusted AI to
      help you set up a CoSeedCouple (site + AI portal) using patterns like
      these. The only cost should be your own domain and hosting choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the current quiet phase, this site does not point its AI portal
      toward any central CoCivium or CoIndex stack. When that changes, the
      update will be explicit and opt-in.
